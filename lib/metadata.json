Thus, -algebra means it is closed under the countable union, i.e., it contains every countable union of itself. <br>Furthermore, since countable set is isomorphic to , meaning that there exists an one-to-one correspondence between the two, we can understand -algebra as the set consists the countably infinite number of the subsets of , where we can index the each of the subsets in natural number bases.<br>Example (example of sigma-algebra and induced algebra).\nLet .

The risk premium represents the compensation that an investor receives in exchange for taking on risk. Generally, the riskier the asset, the higher its risk premium.\n<br>Assumption (assumptions for CAPM). <br>Many homogeneous investors\n<br>Two-period model: the economy lasts for two period of and , where the investors invest at time and receive the payoffs at time .\n<br>Many risky assets and one risk-free asset: mean and covariance of the vector of risky asset rate of return are given by where

(variance): From the driven the risk premium of the market portfolio, we have thus the risk-aversion coefficient can be re-written as Furthermore, for any , we have It follows that the risk premium of the -th asset is where and are called beta term and the market price of risk, respectively.\n<br>Definition (beta-term).\nFrom the formula of risk premium of asset , the first term is denoted as beta-term which denotes <br>the idiosyncratic part of risk premium of the asset .\n<br>the coefficient from the regression of on .\n<br>determining how much the factor loads onto the risk premium of

as the expectation of its payoff discounted by the stochastic discount factor (SDF) which denotes <br>the discounted marginal utility of future consumption () relative to the marginal utility of current consumption ().\n<br>which gets smaller if the investor expects to consume more tomorrow than today.\n<br>which discounts the asset 's payoff much more <br>From the pricing formula, by
